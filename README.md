# Real-time-object-detection

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using OpenCV's DNN module with the MobileNet-SSD model (Caffe).


## Features
- Real-time detection from webcam or video file
- Confidence threshold filtering
- FPS display
- Lightweight model suitable for CPU inference on most laptops


## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `pip` available
- Model files: `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt` and `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel` (download script provided)


## Setup
1. Clone or download the project files into a folder.


2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
